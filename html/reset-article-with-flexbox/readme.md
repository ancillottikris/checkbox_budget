# Intro to the CSS reset and using flexbox

When we set out to build a page from scratch, a CSS reset can really help.

Browsers have built in stylesheets that can help you see your code in a very basic glory. These stylesheets are what make `<strong></strong>` tags bold or `<em></em>` tags italic, without you needing to do anything more.

However, different browsers can have different defaults in other, nuanced ways. A reset ensures that your base styles are identical across all platforms and then you write your application/page's CSS on top of it.

## Containers

There are a number of applications for web pages in journalism. The most common, however, is to serve as a home for your articles. We use containers to limit the amount of horizontal real estate we allow our content to consume, resulting in a nice tight column down the center of the page that's easy for our users to read. A good container grows to be no wider than 1200px, has 5px of padding and auto centers itself.

Interactives, big images, videos, etc. can break out of containers for maximum impact -- leverage this.

## Flexbox

Sometimes layout is hard. Sometimes we want things next to each other. Sometimes we want to dynamically change the order of things. Sometimes we want to make a mosaic. Sometimes, flexbox is the answer.

## Solution

Don't peek! We'll get there. You're only hurting yourself if you look before you're ready.
