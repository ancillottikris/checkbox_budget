### Building a produce app

A produce company has asked you to develop an app that allows their customers to work out how many calories they're purchasing and how much they should expect their bill to be. All they want their customers to do is indicate how many pieces of each produce they want.

They provide you with the following data:

Fruit   | Price/ea | Calories/ea
------- | -------- | -----------
Bananas | $0.50    | 100
Mangos  | $1.50    | 100
Grapes  | $0.75    | 300
Avocado | $1.75    | 463
Apples  | $0.50    | 400

There are many correct answers to this prompt. Yours should include an example of functions, global variables and function variables.
