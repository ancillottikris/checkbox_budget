# Using Comparisons to Balance the Budget

This exercise leverages html and javascript to show how a budget adds up

## Preflight

You know the drill.
1. Pull an update for `edu`
2. Your repo should be called `checkbox_budget`
3. Copy/paste the skeleton (no `readme` or `solution`) into your newly-cloned repo
4. Before you begin, commit what you have (from the copy/paste) so that you have a clean skeleton to reset to should you need to
5. No peeking at the solution

## Exercise
In the interest of time, the stylesheet and a skeleton of the HTML has been provided for you. We will go over the styles in class so make sure you add comments to your copy of the project to remind yourself about the finer points of the page. The pretext of this exercise is that you are an interactive journalist working for a political publication doing a story about how difficult it can be to balance the federal budget.

1. Update the javascript, using your existing knowledge and skillset, to read the budget total at the top and store it as a number.
2. Whenever a checkbox is toggled, find the sum of all checked checkboxes and deduct it from the original total. Update the display to reflect the new amount
3. When the user is over budget, alert them.

## Homework
1. Alerts stop JavaScript. Instead, let's apply a class to the `.total_budget` that will turn it red.
